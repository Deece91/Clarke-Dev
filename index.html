                <div class="bio">
                    <p>I started my career in Marketing in 2016. Creating content and generating leads was fun but I always loved managing the companies websites, building landing pages, tweaking copy and design to get the desired outcome.</p>

                    <p>This is what sparked my interest in Web Development.</p>
                        
                    <p>I started learning with SuperHi and then Codecademy. Since then I have been building sites for friends, business’s and charities.</p>
                        
                    <p>I hope to join a business and be able to develop engaging websites full time.</p>
